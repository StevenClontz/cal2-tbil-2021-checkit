            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose a  well filled with water has height 40 meters and radius 3 meters.  Find an integral which computes how much work is needed to pump all the water out of the well.  Recall that the acceleration of gravity is 9.8 m<m>/\text{s}^2</m> and the density of water is <m>1000\text{kg}/\text{m}^3</m>.
