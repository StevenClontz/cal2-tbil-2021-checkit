            <statement>
                <p>
                    Suppose a  trapezoidal dam has height 35 feet, top width of 55 feet and bottom width of 25 feet.  Water is pressed against the entire surface of the dam. Find an integral which computes the force exerted against this dam. Recall that the pressure of water at depth <m>h</m> feet  is <m>62.4h</m> pounds per square foot.
